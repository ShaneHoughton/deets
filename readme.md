# how to get deets from your merged pull requests
Deets can capture what has been `added`, `changed`, and `fixed` when your PR description contains tags to document those updates:
```html
<added>Added new feature.</added>
<changed>Changed process for completing thing.</changed>
<fixed>Fixed an ongoing issue.</fixed>
```
